# Gaia

Gaia is a small automation software used to control and monitor a greenhouse / 
a plant growth chamber or any other enclosed environment such as an aquarium or
a terrarium.

While Gaia is a standalone app, it can connect to 
[Ouranos](https://gitlab.com/eupla/ouranos.git), a small server that can be used
to more easily configure Gaia with a user interface, log the data, draw
graphs ...

## Note
Gaia requires [event-dispatcher](https://gitlab.com/eupla/dispatcher.git) in 
order to work.

Gaia is still in development and might not work properly.
